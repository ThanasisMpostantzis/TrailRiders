## About Me

Hi! I'm Thanasis, a **Bachelor graduate in Applied Informatics & Computer Science** and currently pursuing a **Master in Software Development & Cloud** at the University of Macedonia. I have several years of experience in software engineering and a strong passion for creating solutions that solve real-world problems.  

This project was born from my personal hobby: motorcycles and cars. I noticed that many enthusiasts face challenges in finding riding partners and organizing rides safely, so I decided to create **TrailRiders** as a solution.

TrailRiders combines my **software engineering experience** with my **passion for vehicles**, aiming to provide enthusiasts a safe and engaging platform to connect and ride together.
